                    <i>Skullgirls</i> is a 2D fighting game developed by Reverge Labs and published by Autumn Games. In Skullgirls, players fight each other with teams of one, two, or three characters, attempting to knock out their opponents or have the most cumulative health when time runs out.

                        With the characters out of the way, it is time to look at some of the mechanics that make 
                        <i>Skullgirls </i>
                        tick. There are a few of them to examine, so let’s take them one by one.
                </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani">Pushblock</h1>
                        <p class="mecha">
                            This is a system in which you can create some space between you and the opponent by pressing two 
                            <b>P </b>
                            buttons. This space gives you some breathing room when you are being pressured. Blocking is a pivotal part of any fighting game, and it is even more important in 
                            <i>Skullgirls</i>
                            , which is really combo-heavy. You can air block in this game which isn’t something you’ll find in many fighters.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani">OTG Combos</h2> 
                        <p class="mecha">
                            OTG is an acronym for ‘Off-the-ground.’ This is a combo that knocks the opponent down and then hits at them while on the ground to continue the combo. This can only be done once per combo, and if you do an OTG combo and the opponent is knocked down again, they automatically recover. Therefore, you are advised to practice combos that cause your opponent to land on their feet so you can perform longer combo strings.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani" >Assists and Tags</h2>
                        <p class="mecha">
                            These are core team mechanics that you’ll need when playing the game to tag in new characters to come into the fray. The typical game of Skullgirls involves three characters whom you can either call to assist or tag in to continue the fight. When you call for an assist, one of your characters, who is off-screen, comes on and does a pre-assigned move and goes back out. This is performed by inputting 
                            <b>LK+MP or MK+HP</b>
                            depending on which character you want to call for an assist. If you pick only two characters, then both inputs will work for the same character.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mecha">
                                On the other hand, if the fight isn’t going your way due to the matchup, you can tag in one of the other characters you have chosen to continue the fight and see if they have a better time out there. To tag in a new character, you input 
                            <b>MP+MK or HP+HK </b>
                            again, depending on the character you want to come in. If you choose only two characters, both inputs will still be available to you.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani" >Snapback</h1>
                        <p class="mecha">
                            This is an offensive system in which you can force the current character off the screen to bring in another character. This is executed by inputting the 
                            <b>QCF+tag command.</b>
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani" >Delay hyper combo</h1>
                        <p class="mecha">
                            Tagging in a new character could be really dangerous as the new character usually has a short window of vulnerability where the opponent can hit them without being able to block. Hence, the 
                            <b>Delay Hyper Combo</b>
                            is necessary. This mechanic is one in which you cancel into the super of the character you’re about to tag in while doing the super of the current character. This results in the super being performed being cut short and another super from the tagged in character taking off. Once done, the newly tagged character remains on screen to continue the fight. It is considered the safest way to tag in a new character.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani" >Combos</h1>
                        <p class="mecha">
                            Combos are integral to this game, and they are intricately built. In Skullgirls 2nd Encore, combos are divided into five stages. The first two stages of a combo are safe and free, but from the third stage, a few things come into play that we’ll have a look at.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h1 class="comehani" >Infinite Prevention System (IPS)</h1>
                        <p class="mecha">
                            This is a system that seeks to reduce the length of a combo and ensure that the game is more fun for both parties. 
                            <b>IPS</b> 
                            kicks in after a certain amount of time, after which the opponent will emit some sparks and then burst out of the combo. 
                            <b>IPS</b>
                            starts tracking during the third stage of a combo and really kicks in if you use a move that you’ve performed before. This way, it discourages infinite combo loops.
